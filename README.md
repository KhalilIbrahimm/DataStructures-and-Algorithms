## Algorithms

The repository includes the following algorithms:

- **Graph Algorithms**
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm (`dijkstra_algorithm.py`): Finds the shortest path in a weighted graph.
  - Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm (`ford_fulkerson_MaxFlow.py`): Computes the maximum flow in a flow network.
  - Kruskal's Algorithm (`kruskal_algorithm.py`): Finds the minimum spanning tree of a graph.
  - Prim's Algorithm (`prims_algorithm.py`): Another approach for finding the minimum spanning tree.

- **Optimization and Scheduling**
  - Knapsack Algorithm (`knapsack.py`): Solves the 0/1 knapsack problem.
  - Interval Scheduling (`interval_scheduling.py`): Finds an optimal subset of non-overlapping intervals.

- **String Matching**
  - Levenshtein Distance (`levenshtein_distance.py`): Calculates the minimum edit distance between two strings.

- **Encoding**
  - Huffman Coding (`huffmans_code_algorithm.py`): Lossless data compression algorithm.

- **Other Algorithms**
  - Stable Matching (`stable_matching.py`): Solves the stable matching problem.
  - Kahn's Algorithm (`kahns_algorithm.py`): Topological sorting of a directed graph.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DataStructures-and-Algorithms.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
    ```bash
    cd DataStructures-and-Algorithms
    ```
3. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

## Usage

Each algorithm can be executed independently. For example, to run Dijkstra's Algorithm:

```bash
python dijkstra_algorithm.py
```
